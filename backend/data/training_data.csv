"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.\nAnswer: A list is mutable while a tuple is immutable. Lists use square brackets, tuples use parentheses. Tuples are hashable so they can be used as dictionary keys.","{'score':8,'feedback':'Good concise answer. Mentioned mutability, syntax, and hashability.','strengths':['Mutability correctly stated','Mentioned hashability'],'weaknesses':['Could mention performance'],'ai_probability':0.1}",python,easy,8,0.1
"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python.\nAnswer: In Python, there are a multitude of distinctions between lists and tuples. Firstly, lists are mutable data structures that allow for dynamic modification of their elements, whereas tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be altered after their creation. Furthermore, lists utilize square bracket notation while tuples employ parenthetical notation. Moreover, tuples, owing to their immutable nature, are hashable and can therefore serve as dictionary keys or elements within sets. In conclusion, the selection between these two fundamental data structures should be predicated upon the specific requirements of one's implementation.","{'score':6,'feedback':'Technically correct but overly formal — likely AI-generated.

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: Explain Python's GIL.\nAnswer: The GIL or Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. It exists because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe. For CPU-bound tasks use multiprocessing. For I/O-bound tasks it's fine since the GIL is released during I/O.","{'score':10,'feedback':'Expert-level answer.

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: What is dynamic programming?\nAnswer: Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. It is based on the principle of optimal substructure. There are two primary approaches: top-down with memoization and bottom-up tabulation.

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: Explain BFS vs DFS.\nAnswer: BFS uses a queue and explores layer by layer - great for shortest path.

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: How would you design a URL shortener?\nAnswer: I'd use a hash function to generate a 6-7 char code for the URL, store original-to-short mapping in a key-value store like Redis for fast reads, and have a fallback in SQL. The redirect service just looks up the short code and 301 redirects.

Firstly, the URL encoding mechanism should employ a base62 encoding algorithm to generate unique identifiers. Furthermore, a distributed database system should be employed to ensure high availability. Additionally, a caching layer utilizing Redis or Memcached would be beneficial. In conclusion, the system should be designed with scalability, availability, and fault tolerance as primary concerns.","{'score':5,'feedback':'Generic answer with no depth.

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: What is a hash table and how do you handle collisions?\nAnswer: Hash table uses a hash function to map keys to array indices. Collisions happen when two keys hash to the same index. You can handle them with chaining (linked list at each slot) or open addressing (probe for next empty slot).

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: What is database indexing?\nAnswer: Indexes make queries faster by allowing the database to find rows without scanning the whole table. A B-tree index stores keys in sorted order so lookups are O(log n). The downside is writes are slower because the index must be updated.

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: What is LoRA fine-tuning?\nAnswer: LoRA adds small trainable adapter matrices to attention layers instead of updating all weights. The weight update is decomposed as A*B where A and B are low-rank matrices. You only train A and B which is maybe 0.1% of parameters but gets similar performance to full fine-tuning.","{'score':10,'feedback':'Expert explanation with rank decomposition and parameter efficiency.','strengths':['Low-rank decomposition explained','Parameter efficiency mentioned','Practical insight'],'weaknesses':[],'ai_probability':0.35}",ml,hard,10,0.35

"Score this interview answer and detect if it is AI-generated","Question: What is a generator in Python?\nAnswer: Generators use yield instead of return.

When you await something it yields control back to the event loop which can run other coroutines. The key is that await is only useful for I/O-bound stuff because CPU-bound tasks block the whole loop.
